## Overview

`spectre-ui-wordpress` is the official WordPress adapter for the Spectre design system.

This plugin loads the compiled Spectre UI CSS on the frontend only, making Spectre's tokens, components, and utilities available to WordPress themes, templates, and companion plugins — without requiring Node tooling or runtime build steps in WordPress.

**This plugin does not define blocks, editor styles, or design logic.**
It exists solely to bridge WordPress with [@phcdevworks/spectre-ui](https://github.com/phcdevworks/spectre-ui) in a safe, predictable way.

### What This Plugin Does

- ✅ Loads a compiled, import-free Spectre UI CSS bundle on the frontend
- ✅ Uses the canonical styles from `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui`
- ✅ Follows WordPress runtime constraints (no Node, no `@import`)
- ✅ Cache-busted via `filemtime()`
- ✅ Provides a stable foundation for Spectre-powered themes and plugins

### What This Plugin Does NOT Do

- ❌ Does not style the WordPress admin UI
- ❌ Does not style the Gutenberg editor
- ❌ Does not provide blocks (see Spectre UI Blocks)
- ❌ Does not define or override design values
- ❌ Does not run Tailwind or PostCSS in WordPress
- ❌ Does not load fonts

**This separation is intentional and enforced.**

## Installation

### Manual Installation (Development)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phcdevworks/spectre-ui-wordpress.git
cd spectre-ui-wordpress
```

2. Install dependencies and build assets:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Symlink or copy into WordPress:

```bash
ln -s $(pwd) /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/spectre-ui-wordpress
# or
cp -r . /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/spectre-ui-wordpress
```

4. Activate **Spectre UI WordPress** in WP Admin → Plugins

## Usage

### Frontend Styling

Once activated, the plugin automatically enqueues:

**`assets/spectre-ui.css`**
Frontend only via `wp_enqueue_scripts`

All Spectre UI classes are now available in:

- theme templates
- custom PHP markup
- custom blocks
- page builder output

### Example (Theme Template)

```php
<article class="sp-card sp-card--elevated">
  <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>

  <div class="sp-stack sp-stack--md">
    <?php the_content(); ?>
  </div>

  <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url() ); ?>" class="sp-btn sp-btn--primary">
    Back to Home
  </a>
</article>
```

## CSS Availability

All Spectre UI classes are available once the plugin is active, including:

### Buttons

```html
<button class="sp-btn sp-btn--primary">Primary</button>
<button class="sp-btn sp-btn--secondary">Secondary</button>
<button class="sp-btn sp-btn--ghost">Ghost</button>
```

### Cards

```html
<div class="sp-card sp-card--elevated">Elevated</div>
<div class="sp-card sp-card--outline">Outline</div>
<div class="sp-card sp-card--ghost">Ghost</div>
```

### Utilities

```html
<div class="sp-stack sp-stack--md"></div>
<div class="sp-container"></div>
```

## Development Notes

### Build Pipeline

The plugin includes a build-time sync script that:

1. Resolves the compiled CSS bundle from `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui`
2. Verifies it is import-free
3. Copies it to `assets/spectre-ui.css`

```bash
npm run build
```

**WordPress never runs build steps at runtime.**
All generated assets are committed for distribution.

## Spectre Design Philosophy

Spectre is a **specification-driven design system** built on three fundamental principles:

### 1. Single Source of Truth

Design values flow from one place: `@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens`. Colors, spacing, typography, shadows, and semantic roles are defined once in JSON, then consumed everywhere. No downstream package invents values.

### 2. Separation of Concerns

- **Tokens** define _meaning_ (what is `brand-500`? what is `surface.card`?)
- **UI** defines _structure_ (how does `.sp-btn` work? what CSS makes a card?)
- **Adapters** translate without duplicating (WordPress loads CSS; it never rewrites design)

### 3. Framework Agnostic

Spectre's core (`tokens` + `ui`) runs anywhere CSS and JavaScript run. Adapters (WordPress, Astro, 11ty) bridge runtimes without locking teams into frameworks.

## Core Rules

### For Tokens (@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens)

- Tokens define **semantic meaning**, not UI behavior
- Output formats: CSS variables (`--sp-*`), JS objects, Tailwind theme
- Designers own `tokens/*.json`; engineers maintain `src/` transforms
- Contrast targets and accessibility constraints are encoded at the token level

### For UI (@phcdevworks/spectre-ui)

- UI **consumes tokens**, never redefines design values
- Ships: compiled CSS (`base`, `components`, `utilities`), type-safe recipes, Tailwind preset
- Every CSS class has a matching recipe (`.sp-btn` → `getButtonClasses()`)
- Literal values in CSS are fallbacks only; real values come from tokens

### For Adapters (spectre-ui-wordpress, spectre-ui-astro, etc.)

- Adapters **translate only**; they never invent CSS or design logic
- WordPress: syncs and enqueues CSS; all styles come from `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui`
- Astro/11ty: wraps Spectre UI classes in framework components
- If it's a design token, it belongs in `spectre-tokens`. If it's a CSS class, it belongs in `spectre-ui`. If it's runtime integration, it belongs in the adapter.

## WordPress Adapter Principles

1. **Single source of truth** – All design lives in `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui`
2. **No CSS duplication** – This plugin never defines `.sp-*` styles
3. **Frontend only** – No admin or editor styling (by design)
4. **Distribution-safe** – Import-free CSS, no Node assumptions at runtime
5. **Adapter, not framework** – Thin by design; translate, don't transform

## Part of the Spectre Suite

- **Spectre Tokens** – Design-token foundation
- **Spectre UI** – Core CSS + class contracts
- **Spectre UI WordPress** – WordPress adapter (this plugin)
- **Spectre UI Blocks** – Gutenberg blocks (separate plugin)
- **Spectre Astro** – Astro adapter

## Roadmap (High Level)

- ✅ Frontend CSS adapter (this plugin)
