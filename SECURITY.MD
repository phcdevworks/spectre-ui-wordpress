# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We aim to support the latest published version of Spectre UI WordPress. Older releases may not receive security fixes. Please ensure you are using the most recent version of the plugin and have updated `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui` to the latest version in your `package.json`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainers or reach out via the private channels listed in the repository (e.g., `SECURITY_CONTACT` if present). Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess impact:
- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Affected versions (if known)

We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe and keep you informed of the fix status. Responsible disclosure is appreciated.
